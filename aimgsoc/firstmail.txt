Hi,

  I am a second year graduate student doing M. Tech in Computer Science in
  Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I am working in area related to
  auto-parallelization under Dr. Shankar Balachandran.

  I would like to contribute to the Polly project. Before making any
  contribution I would like to learn the existing code of Polly. Could you
  please tell me the logical steps to learn the existing system.

  Untill now I was able to build the system as explained here

  Regards,
  Raghesh
