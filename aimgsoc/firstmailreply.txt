Hi Raghesh,

   I just updated the website with a complete example of how to use polly.

   http://wiki.llvm.org/Polyhedral_optimization_framework#Use_Polly

   I propose to start looking at this example.

   Later I propose you either try your own examples or look into some of 
   the files in <polly>/test/Codegen/*.c and play a little with those.

The next step is jumping in the code. All passes used in the example 
mentioned above have corresponding .cpp files in the <polly>/lib 
directory, some also have got header files. Just look a little bit around.

To get really into the code I propose to get a small project and try to 
solve it. You could e.g. analyze a SCoP built by SCoPInfo.cpp and find 
all statements that do not have any write access. Those can easily be 
dead code eliminated.

If you need any help with this please let me know. ;-)

Cheers
Tobi
