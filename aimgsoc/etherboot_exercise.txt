[ I have BCC'ed the all students who submitted a proposal ]

Hello GSoC candidates,

      Many thanks for submitting a GSoC proposal to our organization.

      As we mentioned in a previous email the next step in our evaluation
      process to have you complete a short programming exercise.  We will
      evaluate your solution, and based on that evaluation may invite you to
      interview with us.

      Give the number of proposals we received this year (29), and the short
      window of time for us to make our decisions (12 days), we need to
      pre-qualify applicants for interviews to efficiently use our mentoring
      resources.

      Attached to this email you will find a short interview
      pre-qualification exercise.

      Here are some basic rules for completing this exercise:

      - Solutions must be written in C and may only use the standard
      library.

      - Deadline for submitting your solution is Wednesday, 14 April 2010,
      19:00 UTC.  Solutions received after that time will not be
      considered.

      - Solutions and any questions regarding this exercise should be
      mailed to soc-mentors@etherboot.org .

      - We will offer IRC interview times based on our evaluation of your
      solution.

      We go through the effort of carefully evaluating applicants before
      acceptance because we want to ensure that all those who we accept will
      have a successful, positive GSoC experience. In fact, two of our
      mentors are former GSoC students who have successfully completed
      projects.

      Thanks again for your proposal.  We look forward to receiving your
      solution, and if successfully completed, to having an IRC interview
      with you.

      Regards,

      / Marty /
